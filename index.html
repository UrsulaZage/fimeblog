									<h2><i>My Experience With FIME I</h2></i>
								</header>
								<p>
								Hello there!
                                The program began on the 17th of September,2014. It all began at 1:00pm with an introduction of ourselves and what the FiME project was all about. Then boom! We took off like a rocket beginning with HTML. At first I was at sea , because all I knew about HTML was its definition and what it is. I didn’t know how to program in HTML. I know what you are thinking now, ”This simple language?!”Within 5hrs on that day I got to know how to program in html. Great! right?
                                So far, we have treated PHP, HTML, Java script, CSS, frontlinesms, phonegap and others. I enjoyed all the tutor’s classes but those I enjoyed most were Selorm, Harold, Charisma and Adam’s, although he was moving at a fast pase.
                                I came to FiME with the idea of building a software that will help drug addicts stop abusing drugs and to help obessed people keep their body in shape. Although my idea looked kind of unrealistic, the FiME team did not discourage me. But instead they made me realize that in order to build an application, you need to take into consideration a lot of things most especially the people who are going to use your software.

									My lecturer once told me that before you enter any Information Technology organization, you will find maybe a “think” banner. Mobile Web Ghana doesn’t have this banner but since I joined this organization, I began to do a lot of thinking. And hence, came up with a new idea to build an application where lecturers and students can interact. And this application will enable lecturers upload tutorials where students who missed classes due to very important reasons can have access to them.
                                    Again, I pondered over this idea for weeks and saw that some lecturers will disapprove of this application. So the almighty God gave me a new idea; which is to build an application that will enable event organizers upload their proposals to organizations their seeking sponsorship from. This  will save them the stress of being tossed up and down whenever they want to see the chief executive officer of an organization for sponsorship

                                   I joined FiME with the thinking of, ”I want to give programing a try”. But now folks, I am enjoying programing so much that, every minute I just want to be on the computer coding.
                                   At FiME I get to meet great female programmers with great ideas. I also get to learn a lot of things aside studies from my colleagues. I am so grateful to the FiME team and most especially Madame Florence for an opportunity to be part of this project and I hope to make them proud.
